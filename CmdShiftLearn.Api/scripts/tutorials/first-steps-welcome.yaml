  # First Steps: Welcome to PowerShell!

  ## Welcome, Explorer!

  **Hi there!** I'm your PowerShell guide. If this is your first time seeing PowerShell, don't worry - we'll take this one tiny step at a time.

  ## What is this blue screen?

  What you're looking at is called a "command line" or "terminal." Think of it as a text-based way to talk to your computer. 
  
  The blinking cursor is waiting for you to type something. It's like a conversation:
  - You type a message
  - You press Enter to send it
  - Your computer responds
  
  ## Let's start our adventure!

  In this tutorial, you'll:
  - Send your first message to PowerShell
  - Learn what the "PS" prompt means
  - Use your first real PowerShell command
  - Discover how to find more commands

  Ready to begin? Let's go!

    title: "Say Hello to PowerShell"
    instructions: |
      Let's start with something super simple! Type 'hello' and press Enter.
      
      Don't worry about getting things "right" - this is just to get comfortable typing in PowerShell.
    expectedCommand: "hello"
    hint: "Just type the word 'hello' (without quotes) and press the Enter key."

    title: "Understanding the Prompt"
    instructions: |
      Great job sending your first command! 
      
      Let's look at what's on your screen. You should see something like:
      
      ```
      PS C:\Users\YourName>
      ```
      
      This is called the "prompt" and it tells you:
      - "PS" means you're in PowerShell
      - "C:\Users\YourName" shows where you are in your computer (like which room you're in)
      - ">" is where you type your commands
      
      Let's try our first real PowerShell command. Type 'Get-Date' exactly as shown (capital G and D, with a hyphen) and press Enter.
    expectedCommand: "Get-Date"
    hint: "Type 'Get-Date' with the capital letters and hyphen exactly as shown."

    title: "Your First Real Command"
    instructions: |
      Excellent! You just used a real PowerShell command!
      
      Let's understand what you did:
      
      'Get-Date' follows the 'Verb-Noun' pattern that most PowerShell commands use:
      - 'Get' (the verb) means to retrieve something
      - 'Date' (the noun) is what you want to get
      
      So 'Get-Date' means "Hey computer, fetch me the current date and time!"
      
      Now let's try another 'Get' command. Type 'Get-Location' to see where you are in your computer.
    expectedCommand: "Get-Location"
    hint: "Type 'Get-Location' with capital G and L, with a hyphen between them."

    title: "Discovering Commands"
    instructions: |
      Wonderful! 'Get-Location' showed you which 'folder' (or directory) you're currently in.
      
      PowerShell has hundreds of commands, but you don't need to memorize them! You can discover commands as you need them.
      
      Let's use a command that shows what other commands are available. Type 'Get-Command -Verb Get -Noun *'
      
      This will show all commands that start with 'Get-'
    expectedCommand: "Get-Command -Verb Get -Noun *"
    hint: "Type 'Get-Command -Verb Get -Noun *' exactly as shown. The * is a 'wildcard' that means 'match anything'."

    title: "Getting Help"
    instructions: |
      Amazing progress! You're now discovering PowerShell commands on your own!
      
      One last important thing to learn: how to get help when you need it.
      
      Type 'Get-Help Get-Date' to see instructions for the Get-Date command.
    expectedCommand: "Get-Help Get-Date"
    hint: "Type 'Get-Help Get-Date' exactly as shown to see the help information for the Get-Date command."

      value: "Get-Help"
