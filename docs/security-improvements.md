# Security Improvements for OAuth Setup

## Overview

This document outlines the security improvements made to the CmdShiftLearn.Api project to remove hardcoded credentials from the codebase and replace them with secure environment variable usage.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated appsettings.json**
   - Removed hardcoded credentials for Google OAuth, GitHub OAuth, JWT, and OpenAI
   - Replaced with empty strings as placeholders
   - This ensures no sensitive information is stored in the repository

2. **Enhanced appsettings.Development.json**
   - Added OAuth configuration for local development
   - This file is already in .gitignore to prevent it from being checked into source control

3. **Verified Program.cs Configuration**
   - Confirmed that the application is already using IConfiguration to access settings
   - The code pulls credentials from environment variables via configuration

4. **Created Documentation for Render Deployment**
   - Added docs/render-deployment.md with instructions for setting environment variables in Render
   - Documented all required environment variables with descriptions

5. **Enhanced Debug Controller**
   - Updated the debug controller to display configuration information
   - Added masking for sensitive values
   - This helps verify that environment variables are being loaded correctly

6. **Created Test Scripts**
   - Added scripts/test-env-vars.ps1 for Windows users
   - Added scripts/test-env-vars.sh for Linux/macOS users
   - These scripts set test environment variables for local development

7. **Added API README**
   - Created CmdShiftLearn.Api/README.md with detailed information about the API
   - Included instructions for setting up environment variables
   - Documented all required environment variables

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Separation of Configuration**
   - Development configuration is separate from production
   - Sensitive information is not stored in the repository

2. **Environment Variables for Secrets**
   - All sensitive information is stored in environment variables
   - This follows the 12-factor app methodology for configuration

3. **Masked Logging**
   - Sensitive information is masked in logs
   - Only partial values are displayed for debugging

4. **Documentation**
   - Clear documentation for setting up environment variables
   - Instructions for local development and production deployment

## Testing

To verify that the environment variables are being loaded correctly:

1. Run one of the test scripts:
   - Windows: `scripts/test-env-vars.ps1`
   - Linux/macOS: `scripts/test-env-vars.sh`

2. Start the API:
   ```
   cd CmdShiftLearn.Api
   dotnet run
   ```

3. Navigate to `https://localhost:7071/api/debug/config` to verify the configuration

4. Test authentication with `https://localhost:7071/auth-test.html`

## Render Deployment

For Render deployment, set the environment variables in the Render dashboard:

1. Go to the Render dashboard
2. Select the CmdShiftLearn.Api service
3. Click on the "Environment" tab
4. Add each of the environment variables listed in docs/render-deployment.md
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. Restart the service

## Conclusion

These changes improve the security of the OAuth setup by removing hardcoded credentials from the codebase and replacing them with secure environment variable usage. This ensures that sensitive information is not stored in the repository and follows best practices for configuration management.
