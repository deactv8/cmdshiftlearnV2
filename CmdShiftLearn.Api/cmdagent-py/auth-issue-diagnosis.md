# Authentication Issue Diagnosis

## Summary

The CLI successfully authenticates with Supabase and receives a valid JWT token, but the API rejects this token with the error message: `Bearer error="invalid_token", error_description="The signature key was not found"`.

## Token Details

- **Algorithm**: HS256
- **Key ID (kid)**: 0TRLgU4IVDYEpL98
- **Issuer**: https://fqceiphubiqnorytayiu.supabase.co/auth/v1
- **Audience**: authenticated (correct)
- **Subject**: User ID from Supabase
- **Role**: authenticated

## Root Cause

The API is unable to verify the token signature. This happens because:

1. The token is issued by Supabase and signed with a key that only Supabase knows
2. The API needs access to this key to verify the token
3. The key ID (kid) in the token header is not recognized by the API

## Solutions

There are several approaches to solve this issue:

### 1. Configure the API to recognize Supabase tokens

Update the backend API to use the same signing key or public key as Supabase. The API needs to:

- Add Supabase as a trusted JWT issuer
- Configure the API to use Supabase's JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) endpoint
- Alternatively, share the signature key with the API

### 2. Use a different authentication mechanism

If solution #1 is not feasible, alternatives include:

- Create an "API token" type of authentication specifically for the CLI
- Implement a token exchange endpoint where a Supabase token can be exchanged for an API token
- Add a proxy service that can validate Supabase tokens and issue new tokens for the API

### 3. Pass the token to a different endpoint 

The current token might be valid for different API endpoints. The error specifically mentions "signature key not found" which could mean:

- The token is signed with a key that the API doesn't recognize
- The API might be expecting a token from a different issuer

## Technical Details

### JWT Header
```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "kid": "0TRLgU4IVDYEpL98",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

### JWT Payload
```json
{
  "iss": "https://fqceiphubiqnorytayiu.supabase.co/auth/v1",
  "sub": "9e488da5-bf32-4ed6-8758-ac112b1c149a",
  "aud": "authenticated",
  "exp": 1746083843,
  "iat": 1746080243,
  "email": "hello@cmdshiftlearn.com",
  "phone": "",
  "app_metadata": {
    "provider": "email",
    "providers": [
      "email"
    ]
  },
  "user_metadata": {
    "email": "hello@cmdshiftlearn.com",
    "email_verified": true,
    "phone_verified": false,
    "sub": "9e488da5-bf32-4ed6-8758-ac112b1c149a"
  },
  "role": "authenticated",
  "aal": "aal1",
  "amr": [
    {
      "method": "password",
      "timestamp": 1746080242
    }
  ],
  "session_id": "d7490c4c-95a7-478e-a1c1-cf15493ed63d",
  "is_anonymous": false
}
```

## Recommendations

1. Contact the API team to determine if they support Supabase tokens
2. Check if there is an alternative authentication endpoint or mechanism
3. Consider implementing a token exchange service
