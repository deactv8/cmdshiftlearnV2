  # Process Filtering Challenge
  
  PowerShell makes it easy to find and filter information. In this challenge, you'll practice filtering processes based on specific criteria.
  
  ## Your Task
  
  Write a PowerShell command that finds all processes using more than 100MB of memory, and sorts them by memory usage (in descending order).
  
  Hints:
  - Use `Get-Process` to get the list of processes
  - Use `Where-Object` to filter based on criteria
  - The memory property is called `WorkingSet`
  - Use `Sort-Object` to sort the results
  - You'll need to convert bytes to MB (divide by 1MB)
  
  Good luck!

solution: "Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.WorkingSet -gt 100MB } | Sort-Object -Property WorkingSet -Descending"
validation_type: "fuzzy"
hint: "Start with Get-Process, then pipe to Where-Object with a condition on WorkingSet, then pipe to Sort-Object."
