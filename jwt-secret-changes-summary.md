# JWT Secret Loading Changes Summary

## Overview
The JWT secret loading logic has been updated to support multiple sources with a fallback mechanism. This ensures the application can securely load the Supabase JWT secret from either configuration or environment variables.

## Key Changes

### 1. Multiple Source Support
- First tries to load from `Supabase:JwtSecret` in appsettings.json
- Falls back to `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` environment variable if not found in config
- Provides clear logging about which source is being used

### 2. Secure Handling
- Never prints the full secret in logs, only masked previews
- Logs the length and first/last few characters for verification
- Checks if the secret is valid Base64 (as expected for Supabase)

### 3. Proper JWT Validation
- Uses the raw JWT secret string as-is with UTF-8 encoding
- Does not attempt to decode the Base64 secret before using it
- Ensures consistent handling across all validation points

### 4. Developer Experience
- Provides detailed logging about the JWT secret source and format
- Enhanced debug endpoints with source information
- Graceful handling when no secret is available

### 5. Production Safety
- Consistent secret loading logic across all endpoints
- Proper error handling and fallbacks
- Clear error messages when authentication fails

## Testing
To test these changes:

1. **Config Source**: Set the JWT secret in appsettings.json and verify it's used
2. **Environment Variable**: Remove from config, set SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET env var, verify it's used
3. **No Secret**: Remove from both sources, verify appropriate warnings are shown
4. **Token Validation**: Test with a valid token to ensure authentication works

## Debug Endpoints
The following debug endpoints have been updated to show the JWT secret source:
- `/debug/jwt-config` - Shows configuration details
- `/debug/jwt-secret` - Shows secret details (masked)
- `/debug/validate-token` - Tests token validation
- `/debug/test-jwt-formats` - Tests different secret formats

These endpoints are only available in development mode.
