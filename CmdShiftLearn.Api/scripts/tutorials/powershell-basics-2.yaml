    title: "Where Am I?"
    instructions: >
      Welcome back to PowerShell! In this tutorial, we'll learn how to explore your computer using commands.
      
      Think of your computer as a building with many rooms (folders) containing items (files). To navigate this building, you first need to know where you are.
      
      Let's start by finding out where we are. Type the command:
      
      Get-Location
      
      This is like asking "What room am I in right now?"
    expectedCommand: Get-Location
    hint: Type "Get-Location" and press Enter. This shows your current directory (folder).

    title: "What's in This Folder?"
    instructions: >
      Great! Now you know where you are in your computer's filing system.
      
      Next, let's see what's in your current folder. This is like looking around the room to see what's there.
      
      Type the command:
      
      Get-ChildItem
      
      This will show you all the files and folders in your current location.
    expectedCommand: Get-ChildItem
    hint: Type "Get-ChildItem" and press Enter to see the files and folders in your current location.

    title: "Shortcuts: Using Aliases"
    instructions: >
      Excellent! Get-ChildItem showed you everything in your current folder.
      
      PowerShell has shortcuts called "aliases" for common commands. These are like nicknames for commands.
      
      For example, instead of typing Get-ChildItem, you can type:
      
      dir
      
      Try it now! This does exactly the same thing as Get-ChildItem but is shorter to type.
    expectedCommand: dir
    hint: Type "dir" and press Enter. This is a shorter way to run Get-ChildItem.

  - id: step-4
    title: "More Command Shortcuts"
    instructions: >
      Perfect! As you saw, "dir" is a shortcut for Get-ChildItem.
      
      There's another shortcut for Get-ChildItem: "ls" (from Linux systems).
      
      And Get-Location has the shortcut "pwd" (Print Working Directory, also from Linux).
      
      Let's try the pwd shortcut to see our current location:
      
      pwd
    expectedCommand: pwd
    hint: Type "pwd" and press Enter. This is a shortcut for Get-Location.

    title: "Moving Between Folders"
    instructions: >
      Great! Now let's learn how to move between folders.
      
      To change your current folder (to go to a different "room" in our building analogy), use the command:
      
      Set-Location
      
      Let's move to the C: drive by typing:
      
      Set-Location C:\
      
      This is like saying "Take me to the main floor of the building."
    expectedCommand: Set-Location C:\
    hint: Type "Set-Location C:\" and press Enter. This will take you to the root of your C: drive.

    title: "Using the CD Shortcut"
    instructions: >
      Well done! You've moved to the C: drive.
      
      Just like other commands, Set-Location has a shortcut: "cd" (Change Directory).
      
      Let's move to the Windows folder using this shortcut:
      
      cd Windows
      
      After running this command, you'll be in the Windows folder.
    expectedCommand: cd Windows
    hint: Type "cd Windows" and press Enter. This will take you to the Windows folder on your C: drive.

    title: "Looking Around the Windows Folder"
    instructions: >
      Excellent! You're now in the Windows folder.
      
      Let's see what's in this folder by using one of the commands we learned earlier.
      
      Use either Get-ChildItem or one of its shortcuts (dir or ls) to see the contents of the Windows folder.
    expectedCommand: Get-ChildItem
    hint: Type "Get-ChildItem", "dir", or "ls" to see what's in the Windows folder.

    title: "Understanding File Paths"
    instructions: >
      Great job! You've seen the contents of the Windows folder.
      
      In PowerShell (and computing in general), locations in your file system are described using "paths".
      
      A path is like an address for a file or folder. For example:
      - C:\ is the root of your C: drive
      - C:\Windows is the Windows folder on your C: drive
      
      Let's go back to your starting location. First, let's try going up one level:
      
      cd ..
      
      The two dots (..) mean "go up one level" or "go to the parent folder."
    expectedCommand: cd ..
    hint: Type "cd .." (with a space between cd and the dots) and press Enter. This will take you up one level in the folder structure.

    title: "Go to Your User Folder"
    instructions: >
      Perfect! You've moved up one level, back to the C:\ drive.
      
      Now, let's go to your user folder. This is where your personal files are stored.
      
      Windows stores user folders in C:\Users\[YourUsername]
      
      Let's navigate there using the cd command. Type:
      
      cd Users
      
      This will take you to the Users folder, where all user profiles are stored.
    expectedCommand: cd Users
    hint: Type "cd Users" and press Enter to navigate to the Users folder.

    title: "Exploring More Efficiently"
    instructions: >
      Excellent! You're now in the Users folder.
      
      Sometimes, you want to both see what's in a folder AND get more details.
      
      Let's use a parameter with Get-ChildItem to see more information:
      
      Get-ChildItem -Directory
      
      This will show only the directories (folders) in the current location, not the files.
      
      Parameters are like options that modify how a command works. They always start with a dash (-).
    expectedCommand: Get-ChildItem -Directory
    hint: Type "Get-ChildItem -Directory" and press Enter. This shows only folders (not files) in the current location.

    title: "Congratulations!"
    instructions: >
      Amazing work! You've completed the second PowerShell tutorial!
      
      Let's review what you've learned:
      
      1. Finding your location with Get-Location (or pwd)
      2. Seeing folder contents with Get-ChildItem (or dir, ls)
      3. Moving between folders with Set-Location (or cd)
      4. Going up one level with cd ..
      5. Using parameters like -Directory to modify commands
      
      You can now navigate your computer using PowerShell just like you would with File Explorer, but with typed commands!
      
      In the next tutorial, we'll learn how to store and use information with variables.
      
      Type "exit" to complete this tutorial.
    expectedCommand: exit
    hint: Type "exit" and press Enter to finish this tutorial.
