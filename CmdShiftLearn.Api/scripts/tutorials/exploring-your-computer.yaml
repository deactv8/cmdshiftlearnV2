  # Exploring Your Computer: Finding Your Way

  ## Welcome back, explorer!

  In your last adventure, you learned how to talk to PowerShell and use your first commands. Now, let's explore your computer!

  ## Your Computer is Like a Building

  Think of your computer like a big building with many rooms (folders):
  - Each room (folder) can contain items (files) and doors to other rooms (subfolders)
  - You need to know where you are (your location)
  - You need to know what's around you (files and folders)
  - You need to know how to move between rooms (navigation)

  ## What You'll Learn

  In this tutorial, you'll:
  - Find your current location in the computer
  - Look around to see what's in your current location
  - Move to a different location
  - Find important information about files and folders

  Ready to start exploring? Let's go!

steps:
  - id: step1
    title: "Where Am I?"
    instructions: |
      Just like in real life, when exploring your computer, it's important to know where you are!
      
      Type 'Get-Location' to see your current location in the computer.
      
      (You can also use the shorter alias 'pwd' which stands for "print working directory")
    expectedCommand: "Get-Location"
    hint: "Type 'Get-Location' with capital G and L, with a hyphen between them."

  - id: step2
    title: "What's Around Me?"
    instructions: |
      Great! Now you know where you are. Let's see what's in this location.
      
      Type 'Get-ChildItem' to see all the files and folders in your current location.
      
      (You can also use the shorter aliases 'dir' or 'ls')
    expectedCommand: "Get-ChildItem"
    hint: "Type 'Get-ChildItem' with capital G, C, and I, with a hyphen after 'Get'."
    xp: 20
    
  - id: step3
    title: "Moving to a Different Location"
    instructions: |
      Wonderful! You can now see what files and folders are in your current location.
      
      Let's move to a different location. We'll use a safe place that exists on all Windows computers: the Desktop.
      
      Type 'Set-Location $HOME\\Desktop' to go to your Desktop folder.
      
      (Note: $HOME is a variable that represents your user folder, and the double backslash \\\\ is needed because a single backslash has a special meaning in PowerShell)
    expectedCommand: "Set-Location $HOME\\Desktop"
    hint: "Type 'Set-Location $HOME\\Desktop' exactly as shown. Make sure to use TWO backslashes (\\\\) between $HOME and Desktop."
    xp: 25
    validation:
      type: "contains"
      value: "Set-Location"
    
  - id: step4
    title: "Check Your New Location"
    instructions: |
      Excellent navigation! Now, let's confirm that we actually moved to the Desktop folder.
      
      Type 'Get-Location' again to see your new location.
    expectedCommand: "Get-Location"
    hint: "Type 'Get-Location' just like you did before to see where you are now."
    xp: 15
    
  - id: step5
    title: "Looking Around Your Desktop"
    instructions: |
      Now that we're on the Desktop, let's see what files and folders are here.
      
      Type 'Get-ChildItem' to see the contents of your Desktop.
    expectedCommand: "Get-ChildItem"
    hint: "Type 'Get-ChildItem' just like you did before to see what's on your Desktop."
    xp: 15
    
  - id: step6
    title: "Getting More Information"
    instructions: |
      Let's get more detailed information about the files on your Desktop.
      
      Type 'Get-ChildItem | Select-Object Name, Length, LastWriteTime' to see the name, size, and when each file was last modified.
      
      The '|' symbol (called a "pipe") connects commands together, sending the output of the first command as input to the second command.
    expectedCommand: "Get-ChildItem | Select-Object Name, Length, LastWriteTime"
    hint: "Type 'Get-ChildItem | Select-Object Name, Length, LastWriteTime' exactly as shown. The | symbol is usually above the Enter key on your keyboard."

    validation:
      type: "contains"
      value: "Select-Object"
