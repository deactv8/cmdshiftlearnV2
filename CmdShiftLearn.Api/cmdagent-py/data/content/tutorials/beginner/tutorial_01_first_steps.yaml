      # Meet Your Terminal
      
      Welcome to PowerShell! Think of PowerShell as a special room where you can talk to your computer by typing commands instead of clicking buttons.
      
      The blue area you see is called the "terminal" or "console" - it's like a conversation window between you and your computer.
      
      Let's start simple. Type the word "hello" (without quotes) and press Enter. The computer might tell you it doesn't understand, but that's okay! We're just practicing how to type and send commands.
    instruction: "Welcome to PowerShell! ðŸ‘‹ You're looking at the PowerShell terminal window - a powerful text-based interface for controlling your computer. Unlike clicking on icons, here you'll type commands to tell your computer what to do. Don't worry if it seems intimidating at first - we'll start with the basics. Try typing your name and pressing Enter to see what happens."
    hint: "Just type anything and press Enter to continue. There's no 'correct' answer for this step."

      # Your First Try
      
      Let's start by typing something simple, just to practice using the terminal.
      
      Type:
      
      ```powershell
      hello
      ```
      
      and press Enter. Don't worry if the computer tells you it doesn't understand - that's expected and part of the learning!
    instruction: "Great! You've entered your first input. PowerShell tried to run it as a command, but unless your name happens to be a valid PowerShell command, you probably saw a red error message. This is normal! Let's try typing a simple made-up command. Type `hello` and press Enter."
    command: "hello"
    validation_type: "exact"
    hint: "Type exactly the word 'hello' (without quotes) and press the Enter key."

      # Understanding Command Not Found
      
      Great job typing your first command! You probably saw a message saying PowerShell doesn't recognize "hello" - that's normal!
      
      PowerShell only understands specific commands. When it sees something it doesn't recognize, it tells you with a "command not found" message.
      
      This is like trying to speak a foreign language - you need to use words the computer understands.
      
      Let's try a real command next.
    instruction: "You should see an error message saying PowerShell doesn't recognize `hello` as a command. This is an important lesson: PowerShell only understands specific commands (called 'cmdlets'). The red text isn't something to fear - it's just PowerShell telling you it doesn't understand what you're asking. Now let's try a real command that PowerShell does understand."
    hint: "Read through this explanation about error messages. They're a normal part of working with PowerShell!"

      # Your First Real Command
      
      Let's try a real command. Type:
      
      ```powershell
      Get-Date
      ```
      
      Type it exactly as shown, with the capital G and D. Then press Enter.
      
      This is a real PowerShell command that will show you the current date and time.
    instruction: "Now let's try a real PowerShell command that the system understands. Type `Get-Date` and press Enter to see the current date and time on your system. Notice the command follows a 'Verb-Noun' pattern, where 'Get' is the action and 'Date' is what you're acting on."
    command: "Get-Date"
    validation_type: "exact"
    hint: "Type 'Get-Date' with the capital G and D, then press Enter. PowerShell is not case-sensitive, but this capitalization style makes commands easier to read."

    title: "Understanding Get-Date"
    content: |
      # Understanding Get-Date
      
      Excellent! You just ran your first real PowerShell command and saw the current date and time.
      
      Let's understand what just happened:
      
      "Get-Date" is a PowerShell command (or "cmdlet" pronounced "command-let").
      
      PowerShell commands follow a "Verb-Noun" pattern:
      - "Get" is the verb (the action)
      - "Date" is the noun (what to act on)
      
      So "Get-Date" means "get me the date information".
    instruction: "Perfect! The `Get-Date` command displays the current date and time on your system. PowerShell commands are consistent and predictable - they almost always start with a verb like 'Get', 'Set', 'New', or 'Remove', followed by what you want to act on. This Verb-Noun pattern makes PowerShell commands easier to discover and remember."
    hint: "Read through this explanation to understand how PowerShell commands are structured."

      # Finding Your Location
      
      Let's try another command. Type:
      
      ```powershell
      Get-Location
      ```
      
      This will show you where you are in your computer's filing system.
      
      Again, notice the Verb-Noun pattern: "Get" (action) + "Location" (what).
    instruction: "Now let's find out where we are in the file system. Type `Get-Location` to see your current directory. This command follows the same Verb-Noun pattern as Get-Date. Think of it as asking PowerShell 'Get me my current Location on the computer.'"
    command: "Get-Location"
    validation_type: "exact"
    hint: "Type 'Get-Location' and press Enter. This will show you your current location (directory/folder) on the computer."

    title: "Learning About Commands"

      # Learning About Commands
      
      Great! "Get-Location" showed you your current position in your computer's filing system.
      
      Think of your computer like a building with many rooms (folders). "Get-Location" tells you which room you're standing in right now.
      
      PowerShell has hundreds of commands! How do you learn about them?
      
      Let's use a special help command. Type:
      
      ```powershell
      Get-Help Get-Date
      ```
      
      This will show information about how the Get-Date command works.
    instruction: "Well done! `Get-Location` (similar to 'pwd' in other shells) shows your current location in the file system. PowerShell has hundreds of commands, and you don't need to memorize them all. You can get help for any command. Let's try it now - type `Get-Help Get-Date` to see information about how the Get-Date command works."
    command: "Get-Help Get-Date"
    validation_type: "exact"
    hint: "Type 'Get-Help Get-Date' and press Enter. This will show documentation about how to use the Get-Date command."

      # Finding Available Commands
      
      Perfect! The help system showed you information about the Get-Date command.
      
      You can use "Get-Help" with any command to learn how it works.
      
      But how do you discover what commands exist in the first place?
      
      Let's use another command:
      
      ```powershell
      Get-Command
      ```
      
      This will show a list of all available commands in PowerShell.
      
      Type "Get-Command" and press Enter. You'll see a LOT of commands scroll by - that's okay! There are hundreds of commands available.
    instruction: "Great! You just used the `Get-Help` command to learn about `Get-Date`. This is one of the most useful commands in PowerShell - whenever you need to understand how to use a command, you can get help for it. But how do you discover what commands exist in the first place? Type `Get-Command` to see a list of all available commands in PowerShell."
    command: "Get-Command"
    validation_type: "exact"
    hint: "Type 'Get-Command' and press Enter. Don't worry about the long list of results - we'll learn how to filter this later."

      # Your First Calculation
      
      Excellent! You've just seen the vast library of commands available in PowerShell.
      
      PowerShell can also do math for you. Try typing a simple calculation:
      
      ```powershell
      2 + 2
      ```
      
      Type this and press Enter to see PowerShell calculate the result.
    instruction: "Excellent! You've just seen the vast library of commands available in PowerShell. There are hundreds of them! PowerShell can also do math for you. Try typing a simple calculation: `2 + 2` and press Enter to see PowerShell calculate the result."
    command: "2 + 2"
